README






Update username in setEnvironmentVars.bash
	USER_NAME

New install: 
	Set TMP_PREFIX in setEnvironmentVars.bash
	Run hpcInstall.sh

	Ensure that you have a working .pex folder:
		mkdir ~/.pex
		mkdir ~/.pex/install


Running:
	Set cluster name to whatever you want in setEnvironmentVars.bash
	CLUSTER_NAME
	This should be unique for each cluster you want to start on HPCC


Heron:
	Configurations are in dynamo-data github repository. Simply redirect configuration in build directory to new configs
		dynamic_fault_tolerance/configurations/heron-0.17.8

		Example: 
			cd $TMP_PREFIX/heron;mv conf confOld;ln -s /home/rcf-proj2/jnw/geoffret/dynamo-data-github/dynamic_fault_tolerance/configurations/heron-0.17.8/ conf; cd -

	IMPORTANT: 
		Need to setup new heron configuration folder for each "cluster" on HPC. Simply compare conf/exampleHPCC and exampleHPCC2 to find differences
